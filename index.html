    </h3>
    <p>This page is to up date all of our family and friends on what has been going on in our lives over the last couple of years. It is really a way for me to share with everyone that is family to see where Geoff has been and some of the things that
      he has done while he has been in the Navy. It is to also pay tribute to a wonderful mother/grandmother, dad/grandfather and brother/uncle that have gone on to be with our Lord. Please check back on a regular basis and I will keep the page
      up-to-date as events happen. The pictures and information for Geoff will always be in a past tense to observe all OPSEC regulations. So please bare with us as circumstances change in Geoff's life and mine. There will be a page for leaving
      comments and notes to Geoff if you feel the desire to send him or me a note. Thank you for stopping by and we love and miss all of you that we do not get to see regularly.</p>
